- Axios;                                                                             - Express;
                                                                                     - Celebrate;

                                                                                     - Rest Api;

## Available Scripts

### In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

#### Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
#### Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
#### You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

#### Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
#### See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

#### Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
#### It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
#### Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

#### **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

#### If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

#### Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. #### All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

#### You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we #### understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
